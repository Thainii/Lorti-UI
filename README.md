# Lorti-UI
This is modified [Lorti UI](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22483-LortiUI.html) addon (World of Warcraft) that is working with the most recent patch (eventually).

This addon is belongs to [lorti](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22483-LortiUI.html) who is the original author. After the addon survived for more than 2 years, after the last official updated at Oct. 29. 2013, it finally stopped working with the newest battle.net [changes in Blizzard's 6.2.4 API](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742784697). I modified it to make it work, at least for me.

Improvements, and bug reports should be addressed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Thainii/Lorti-UI/issues)


Thank you for your interest



Description
-----------
This Addon will turn all your default UI black.

F.A.Q.
1. How can I open calendar and tracking menu?
    To open calendar you use right click on minimap and to open tracking menu you use middle click on minimap.

2. Is it possible to turn on/off macros names or hotkeys display?
    Absolutely, you can do it via simple editing of config file. Open the addon directory (AddOns/Lorti UI), open the file called   config.lua with notepad. To turn on/off macros names you need to find the table called 'cfg.macroname' and change the 'show' row to true/false respectively. To turn on/off hotkeys you need to find the table called 'cfg.hotkeys' and do the same.

3. Can you style the addon named X?
    Styling other addons is not intended right now. This is default UI styling addon
